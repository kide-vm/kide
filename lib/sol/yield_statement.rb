  # A Yield is a lot like a Send, which is why they share the base class CallStatement
  # That means it has a receiver (self), arguments and an (implicitly assigned) name
  #
  # On the ruby side, normalisation works pretty much the same too.
  #
  # On the way down to SlotMachine, small differences become abvious, as the block that is
  # yielded to is an argument. Whereas in a send it is either statically known
  # or resolved and cached. Here it is dynamic, but sort of known dynamic.
  # All we do before calling it is check that it is the right type.
  class YieldStatement < CallStatement

    # A Yield breaks down to 2 steps:
    # - Setting up the next message, with receiver, arguments, and (importantly) return address
    # - a SimpleCall,

    # this breaks into two parts:
    # - check the calling method and break to a (not implemented) dynamic version
    # - call the block, that is the last argument of the method

    # check that the calling method is the method that the block was created in.
    # In that case variable resolution is reasy and we can prceed to yield
    # Note: the else case is not implemented (ie passing lambdas around)
    #      this needs run-time variable resolution, which is just not done.
    #      we brace ourselves with the check, and exit (later raise) if . . .
