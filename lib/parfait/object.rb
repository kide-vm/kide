# From a programmers perspective an object has hash like data (with instance variables as keys)
# and functions to work on that data.
# Only the object may access it's data directly.

# From an implementation perspective it is a chunk of memory with a type as the first
# word (instance of class Type).

# Objects are arranged or layed out (in memory) according to their Type
# every object has a Type. Type objects are immutable and may be reused for a group/class
# of objects.
# The Type of an object may change, but then a new Type is created
# The Type also defines the class of the object
# The Type is **always** the first entry (index 0) in an object
