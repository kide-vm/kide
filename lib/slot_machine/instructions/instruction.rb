module SlotMachine

  # Base class for SlotMachine instructions
  # At the base class level instructions are a linked list.
  #
  # SlotMachine::Instructions are created by the Sol level as an intermediate step
  # towards the next level down, the Risc level.
  # SlotMachine and Risc are both abstract machines (ie have instructions), so both
  # share the linked list functionality (In Util::List)
  #
  # To convert a SlotMachine instruction to it's Risc equivalent to_risc is called
  #
  class Instruction

    # to_risc, like the name says, converts the instruction to it's Risc equivalent.
    # The Risc machine is basically a simple register machine (kind of arm).
    # In other words SlotMachine is the higher abstraction and so slot instructions convert
    # to many (1-10) risc instructions

    # The argument that is passed is a MethodCompiler, which has the method and some
    # state about registers used. (also provides helpers to generate risc instructions)
