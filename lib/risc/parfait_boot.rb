module Parfait

  # The general idea is that compiling is creating an object graph. Functionally
  # one tends to think of methods, and that is complicated enough, sure.
  # But for an object system the graph includes classes and all instance variables
  #
  # And so we have a chicken and egg problem. At the end of the boot function we want
  # to have a working Space object
  # But that has instance variables (List and Dictionary) and off course a class.
  # Or more precisely in rubyx, a Type, that points to a class.
  # So we need a Type, but that has Type and Class too. hmmm
  #
  # The way out is to build empty shell objects and stuff the neccessary data into them
  #  (not use the normal initialize way)
  #  (PPS: The "real" solution is to read a rx-file graph and not do this by hand
  #    That graph can be programatically built and written (with this to boot that process :-))


  # temporary shorthand getter for the space
  # See implementation, space is now moved to inside the Object class
  # (not module anymore), but there is a lot of code (about 100, 50/50 li/test)
  # still calling this old version and since it is shorter . . .
