module Risc

  # A Builder is used to generate code, either by using it's api, or dsl
  #
  # The code is added to the method_compiler.
  #
  # Basically this allows to express many Risc instructions with extremely readable code.
  # example:
  #  space << Parfait.object_space # load constant
  #  message[:receiver] << space  #make current message's (r0) receiver the space
  # See http://ruby-x.org/rubyx/builder.html for details

    # clobbering registers and so the allocate and even move would be difficult.

    # an inbuilt one, to avoid call overhead for 99.9%
    # The factories allocate in 1k, so only when that runs out do we really need a call.
    # Note:
    #   Unfortunately (or so me thinks), this creates code bloat, as the calling is
    #   included in 100%, but only needed in 0.1. Risc-level Blocks or Macros may be needed.
    #   as the calling in (the same) 40-50 instructions for every basic int op.
    #
    # The method
    # - grabs a Integer instance from the Integer factory
    # - checks for nil and calls (get_more) for more if needed
    # - returns the RiscValue (Register) where the object is found
    #
    # The implicit condition is that the method is called at the entry of a method.
    # It uses a fair few registers and resets all at the end. The returned object
    # will always be in r1, because the method resets, and all others will be clobbered.
    #
    # Return RegisterValue(:r1) that will be named integer_tmp
